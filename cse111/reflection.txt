Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I saw the usefulness and power of functions very greatly. The most powerful
experience was when I was writing code for an algothrims class. I decided
that I would apply what I was learning in this class to that class and it made
me learn how to use functions very well. It helped me solidify what I was learning
and how to use asserts properly. Before, I had no idea what I was doing with
those; however, after this class, I know how to use functions and asserts
efficiently.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
They help make sure that the functions are working properly and efficiently.
They help make sure that you don't have to worry about them failing. Allowing the
test functions to loop means that it can iterate through your program hundreds of
times. This allows a person to feel that they have done a good job with their code.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
My process is first looking at the recommendations VSCode gives. If that doesn't
quite make sense, I use the debugging tool to really help me learn what I need to 
do and where. Then, I fix what that tool shows me. Something I could do to improve My
process is use the try and except functions more. I never really used them although I
know that they are useful. They help catch and explain bugs. Not only those, but also
using asserts more! They are extremely handy in catching bugs.
